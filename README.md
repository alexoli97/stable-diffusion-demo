# Stable Diffusion from Scratch

This project implements Stable Diffusion from scratch, based on the original architecture and concepts. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of the inner workings of Stable Diffusion by building it step-by-step.

## Project Overview

This implementation of Stable Diffusion includes:

- Custom UNET architecture
- Attention mechanisms
- Diffusion process
- CLIP text encoder integration
- Image generation pipeline

## Key Features

- Modular architecture allowing for easy experimentation
- Step-by-step implementation of the diffusion process
- Integration with pre-trained CLIP model for text encoding
- Custom sampling methods for image generation
